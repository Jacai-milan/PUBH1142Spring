    "* Spreadsheet: A spreadsheet is a file format primarily designed for working with numbers and performing basic calculations and data analysis. It organizes data into rows and columns, and it's typically used for simpler, smaller datasets that require visual representation and quick calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Database: A database is a more complex system for storing, retrieving, and managing large amounts of structured data. It organizes data into tables (like a spreadsheet), but it is designed for more complex relationships between data and supports more advanced querying, indexing, and security features.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Advantages:\n",
    "* Easy to use: Spreadsheets are user-friendly and familiar to many people.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quick data entry: You can easily add or change data on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualization: Tools like graphs, charts, and pivot tables help visualize trends in health data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low cost: Spreadsheets are generally inexpensive and often come bundled with office software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Limited scalability: Spreadsheets are not ideal for handling large datasets or databases with thousands of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Error-prone: Manual data entry and lack of validation can lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of data integrity: Spreadsheets donâ€™t enforce relationships between data and have limited capacity for complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficult to collaborate: While cloud-based options help, managing multiple users on a single file can be cumbersome.\n",

    "## Advantages:\n",
    "* Scalability: Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data integrity: Databases enforce data integrity through validation rules and relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advanced querying: Databases support complex queries, which help extract valuable insights from large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaboration: Multiple users can access and interact with the data simultaneously, with proper access control.\n",
    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Complexity: Setting up and maintaining a database requires technical knowledge.\n",
